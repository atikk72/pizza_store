Today, I delved into a comprehensive sales analysis project focused on pizza sales,
utilizing a wide range of SQL queries. It was a fantastic opportunity to apply various techniques, from basic filters to complex subqueries. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of what I accomplished:


Data Filtering: I started with filtering the dataset to focus on specific time frames and pizza types, allowing for a more targeted analysis.


Aggregations: I calculated total sales, average order values, and sales by category, helping to uncover key insights about customer preferences.


Grouping and Summarization: By grouping data by regions and time periods, I was able to visualize trends and identify peak sales times.


Subqueries: Implemented subqueries to compare sales performance across different segments, providing deeper insights into customer behavior.


Visual Representation: Although I focused on SQL, I also started thinking about how to visualize these insights for more impactful storytelling.


This project has not only enhanced my SQL skills but also reinforced my understanding of how data analysis drives business decisions. I'm excited to keep building on this foundation and explore more complex datasets!
